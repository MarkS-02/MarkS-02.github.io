## Directions

CMSC320 students will turn in a tutorial that will walk users through the entire data science pipeline: 
data curation, parsing, and management; exploratory data analysis; hypothesis testing and machine learning
to provide analysis; and then the curation of a message or messages covering insights learned during the
tutorial. 

Students may choose an application area and dataset(s) that are of interest to them; please feel
free to be creative about this! (For some ideas and possible data sources, see the slides from the first
lecture.) The tutorial should be self-contained, a mix of Markdown prose and Python code, and delivered
as a GitHub statically-hosted Page (described below)

In general, the tutorial should contain at least **1500** words of prose (excluding the comments) and **150**
lines of (nonpadded, legitimate) Python code, along with appropriate documentation, visualization, and
links to any external information that might help the reader. 

You are welcome to do this project individually or in a group of size at most four; we’ll scale up the expectations accordingly as group size increases.

## What To Submit

The deliverable for this tutorial will be a single URL pointing to this publicly-hosted GitHub Pages-backed website submitted to ELMS. 

It is due by **11:59PM on Saturday, May 18th.** *Every student of each group should submit.* 
We will not (cannot) accept late assignments.

Please make sure to include your name (and the names of all group members) at the top of your deliverable, after the title.

## How to do Github Pages

GitHub provides a service called Pages (https://pages.github.com/) that provides website hosting func-
tionality backed by a GitHub-based git repository. We would like you to host your final project on a GitHub
Pages project site. To do this, you will need to:

1. Create a GitHub account (or use the one you already have) with username <username>.
    
2. Create a git repository titled username.github.io; make sure username is the same as whatever you
chose for your global GitHub account.

3. Create a project within this repository. This is where you’ll dump your iPython Notebook file and
an HTML export of that Notebook file.

These instructions are also given directly on the front page of https://pages.github.com/; followingthose instructions should be fine!
